Use the image from the previous week.

1. Compute and display the **histogram** of the image.  
   - Choose a reasonable number of bins (you can show multiple histograms with different bin counts).  

2. Apply **histogram equalization** to enhance the image contrast.  
   - Display the updated (equalized) image.  

## Expected Submission

- Original image.  
- Histograms of the original image (with different bin counts).  
- Equalized image.  
- Source code used to compute and visualize the results.
