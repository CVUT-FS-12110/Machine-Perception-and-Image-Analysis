# Assignment

1. Collect a suitable image
   - Take a picture with your camera/cellphone
   - The image should contain a **rectangular object** in perspective with a distinctive background.  
   - Example: a framed painting on a wall photographed from an angle.

2. **Affine Transformation**  
   - Choose **3 corner points** of the rectangular object.  
   - Compute and apply an **affine transformation** to warp the object.

3. **Perspective Transformation**  
   - Choose **4 corner points** of the object.  
   - Compute and apply a **perspective (homography) transformation** to warp the object.

4. **Explanation**  
   - Explain how the values in your **transformation matrices** correspond to your **input image** and chosen points.

## Expected Submission

- Original image.  
- Affine-transformed image.  
- Perspective-transformed image.  
- Coordinates of the points used for transformations.  
- Calculated transformation matrices.  
- Source code used to perform the transformations.
