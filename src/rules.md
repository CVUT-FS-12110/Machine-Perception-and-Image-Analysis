# Rules

## Assignments

- Submit your solution trough moodle in given timeframe.
- Every submission has to contain PDF (not-zipped) with solution report called.
  `<your_name>-lab<week_number>.pdf` (for example `John_Doe-lab3.pdf` ).
- Additional files (images, runnable python scripts, colab notebooks) submit in zip file named in the same pattern as pdf file (`<your_name>-lab<week_number>.zip`).

### PDF Report Structure

- Title Page
  - Include your **name**, **date**, and **lab week**.
- Introduction
  - **Briefly** state the **goal** of your work and what result you want to achieve.
- Methodology and Results
  - Include **images** (e.g., inputs, intermediate results, outputs) with captions.  
  - Show **results** such as processed images, tables, charts, or plots, each with captions and short explanations.  
  - Ensure all elements (images, tables,results) are **connected with concise explanations**.  
- Conclusion and Discussion
  - Evaluate your results.  
  - Justify your choice of **methodology** and **hyperparameters**.  
- Appendix
  - Provide **code snippets** with captions.  

### PDF Report Guidelines

- General Guidelines
  - Keep the report **as short as possible**.  
  - **Do not** include lengthy explanations of methods or unrelated background theory.  
  - **Do** explain why you chose your specific approach.  
- Use of Generative AI  
  - You are encouraged to use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) during your work.  
  - You remain fully responsible for any AI-generated content that you include.  
  - You must be able to understand, explain, and defend the AI output you decide to use.  
  - If you cannot reasonably explain AI-generated parts of your work, it will be treated as academic misconduct and may be referred to the Ethics Commission.  
  - If you use generative AI, it is recommended to include an appendix with the **full communication** (prompts and responses).
- Clarity and Integrity of Work  
  - Provide only the information that is necessary and relevant.  
  - Avoid unnecessary text or filler content.
  - Adding extra content to hide flaws or mistakes will be considered academic misconduct.  

### Template and Formating

- Images can be placed at the end of the document.
- Images should have a width of **100% of the line width**. If maintaining the aspect ratio makes this impractical, adjust the size appropriately using common sense.
- You can use provided [Latex template](template/svao_template.zip)
- You can look at [sample pdf file](template/svao_template.pdf)
